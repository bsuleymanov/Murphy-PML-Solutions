After your yearly checkup, the doctor has bad news and good news. The bad news is that you tested positive
for a serious disease, and that the test is 99\% accurate (i.e., the probability of testing positive given that you
have the disease is 0.99, as is the probability of testing negative given that you donâ€™t have the disease). The
good news is that this is a rare disease, striking only one in 10,000 people. What are the chances that you
actually have the disease? (Show your calculations as well as giving the final result.)
\\ \\
\textbf{Solution} \\
Let $T$ be a binary variable that stands for test positiveness and $D$ be a binary variable that stands for having the disease. Accuracy of the test is 99\%, which means: $\Pr(T=1|D=1) = 0.99 \text{ and } \Pr(T=0|D=0) = 0.99.$ \\
$Pr(D=1) = 10^{-4}.$ Our task is to find $\Pr(D=1|T=1)$. \\ \\
According to Bayes' rule, we have

\begin{flalign*}
\Pr(D=1|T=1) &= \frac{\Pr(T=1|D=1)\Pr(D=1)}{Pr(T=1)} \\
& = \frac{\Pr(T=1|D=1)\Pr(D=1)}{\Pr(T=1|D=1)\Pr(D=1) + \Pr(T=1|D=0)\Pr(D=0)}. &&
\end{flalign*} 

\begin{flalign*}
\Pr(D=1|T=1) = \frac{0.99 \cdot 10^{-4}}{0.99 \cdot 10^{-4} + 0.01 \cdot 0.9999} \approx 0.0098. &&
\end{flalign*}
